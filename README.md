Crossword of Echoes

This is a single-file crossword web app that generates a 10-word crossword using the provided words and poetic clues. It includes a Wordle-style flip animation when checking letters.

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your browser's Open File).
2. Fill letters into the grid and click "Check". You have 3 tries. After uses, "Show Answers" becomes available.

Notes:
- The crossword generator attempts multiple layouts; if it cannot place words, it will alert which words failed.
- The code is self-contained (HTML + CSS + JS) and designed to be portable.

If you want a different selection of words (more words, or different words), tell me which ones and I'll update the puzzle.
